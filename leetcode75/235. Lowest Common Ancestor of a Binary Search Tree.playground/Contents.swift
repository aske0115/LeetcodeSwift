 Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.

 According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

  

 Example 1:


 Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
 Output: 6
 Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.
 Example 2:


 Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
 Output: 2
 Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
 Example 3:

 Input: root = [2,1], p = 2, q = 1
 Output: 2
  

 Constraints:

 The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 105].
 -109 <= Node.val <= 109
 All Node.val are unique.
 p != q
 p and q will exist in the BST.
